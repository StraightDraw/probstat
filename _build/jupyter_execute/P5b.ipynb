    "2. Hint: restrict the probability space by removing an A and J from the deck. Instead of using the conditional probability formula, often it is easier to simply work a standard probability question with a different probability space. We have 50 cards remaining in the deck, and two of the subsets in our value partition have only three cards, not four, since one Ace and one Jack are no longer in the deck. Let $T$ be the event set of having exactly two pair after the flop."
