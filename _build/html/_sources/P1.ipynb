I was coaching students who were preparing for the Ohio math graduation test, and it was a viable keyword approach. Given the previous five years of test questions, a kid could get the right answer more than 90\\% of the time by using the operation indicated by the keyword. Just multiply probabilities if asked about events $A$ **and** $B$ happening. Add probabilities if  asked about events $A$ **or** $B$ happening. My incorrect mathematics was helpful to students on that particular test.\n",
