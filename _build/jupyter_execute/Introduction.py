Professional gamblers and poker players rely upon mathematics to earn their living. Career paths for professional gamblers include running casinos, betting parlors, and lotteries in places where such things are legal. They offer odds for betting on athletic events and horse races. They design and perfect games of chance for casinos, and they verify that those games are fair. Professional poker players are the most high profile example of professional gamblers. Twenty years ago, few people outside Vegas knew of the legendary Doyle "Texas Dolly" Brunson. Today, many learn about poker celebrities like Phil "The Phenom" Ivey, Vanessa "The Lady Maverick" Rousso, Daniel "Kid Poker" Negraneu or the "Duchess of Poker" Annie Duke by watching high stakes poker on TV.

What mathematics do they use? They use *probability* to predict the future. They use *statistics* to analyze the past. With an understanding of both, they manufacture hundreds of small edges over their competition to earn money.
