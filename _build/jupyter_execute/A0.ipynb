    "5. [Subsetting a Data Frame](../A2a.ipynb): Using the subset() function to extract specific types of data points from a data frame.\n",
    "6. [Creating a Data Frame](../A2b.ipynb): Entering data into R by creatinng vectors using the concatenate function **c()** and then joining them into a dataframe.\n",
    "7. [Creating a Grid of Graphics](../A2c.ipynb): When displaying multiple graphical objects at once, we can use the **layout()** and **matrix()** functions to create a grid. The graphical objects will be reduced in size and laid out as we specify. The result saves space and helps to organize content in a more meaningful way."
