    "We begin our investigation of **statistical hypothesis testing** by looking at the $t$-tests. Though mathematicians had long understood many of the properties of the *normal distribution* and how it might be used for data analysis, the $z$-test based upon it generated a brittle statistic that required large sample sizes."

In other words, if the participants were human beings, they were not allowed to colloborate with, speak to or copy from another research participant. **Homogeneity of the variances** asserts that the standard deviations of all research samples are equal.\n",

    "We can check the normality assumption by assessing a QQ plot and a density plot. The QQ plot should be roughly linear if the sample data are approximately normally distributed. The density plot will show a bell-shaped distribution if the sample data are approximately normally distributed. The density plot doesn't have to be perfectly bell-shaped nor perfectly symmetric. Some minor anomalies can exist in the density plot as long as an overall shape is approximately bell-shaped."

    "The vital modernaization that the $t$-tests have brought to statistics is that the homogeneity of the variances assumption can be violated, at least to some degree, yet the test still retains its accuracy. We will conduct Welch's $t$-test which is the modern variant that focuses upon unequal standard deviations. Still, we need to avoid **sharply unequal** sample sizes which accentuate the impact of unequal standard deviations. Hence, in this course, we require the ratio of the sample sizes to be no more unequal than $2:1$."

    "The **independent samples** test compares and constrasts the means between two research samples as in a *treament vs. control* design.

    "The **matched pairs** test compares and constrasts the means between two matched research samples as in a *pretest vs posttest* design.

The matching can occur in reaction-time studies where dominant hand reactions are compared to non-dominant hand reactions.\n",

To test it, the company could collect 25 different cans from different batches and find the average number of ounces in the cans. The population mean is clearly 12 oz. The compnay is hoping not to reject the null which would indicate the cans are being filled to some different value, not the 12 oz."
