<li><p>Two cards are drawn from a well-shuffled, standard deck of cards. What is the probability of drawing 2 hearts?</p></li>
<li><p>A single card is drawn from a well-shuffled, standard deck of cards. What is the probability of not drawing a face card?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the probability that a randomly dealt bridge hand (13 cards) has exactly 7 spades?</p></li>
<li><p>ELENA writes the letters of her name on slips of paper and draws one at random. Find the probability of the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Drawing an E.</p></li>
<li><p>Drawing an L.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The state of Alaska has license plates with 2 letters followed by 3 numbers. What is the probability, if letters and numbers are chosen at random, that no letter or number is repeated?</p></li>
<li><p>A social agency is investigating a bank’s claim that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10\%\)</span> of their successful loan applications to construction companies go to minority-owned firms. They randomly select <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(30\)</span> loans of which only <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2\)</span> are to minorities. What is the probability of this happening if the bank’s claim is actually true?</p></li>
<li><p>A committee is being formed at the United Nations, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1\)</span> person will be selected at random for president. If there are <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(8\)</span> people from Japan, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(6\)</span> from New Zealand, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(12\)</span> from Russia and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(4\)</span> from Belarus in the drawing, find the probability of the person:</p>

<li><p>The letters ENTW are in a bag. If 4 letters are drawn (without replacement) from the bag, what is the probability they spell “newt”?</p></li>
<li><p>A red marble and 4 white marbles are placed in an urn. If 2 are drawn at random (without replacement), find the probability that:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The red marble is drawn first.</p></li>
<li><p>The red marble is drawn last.</p></li>
<li><p>The red marble is not drawn at all.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>American Roulette tables have 38 slots numbered 1 – 36, 0 and 00. Find the probability of the ball landing on an odd number for three consecutive spins.</p></li>
<li><p>Thirteen cubes numbered 1 to 13 are placed in a bag. If two are drawn at random without replacement, what is the probability that:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Both are odd?</p></li>
<li><p>Exactly one is even?</p></li>
<li><p>None are even?</p></li>

<li><p>A single card is drawn from a well-shuffled, standard deck of cards. What is the probability of drawing a spade?</p></li>
<li><p>A single card is drawn from a well-shuffled, standard deck of cards. What is the probability of drawing a nine?</p></li>
<li><p>Two appellate court judges will be appointed at random (which might make more sense than our current filibuster-riddled process!) from a panel of trial court judges that includes 23 men and 7 women. Find the probability that (a) both judges will be female, (b) neither will be female, and (c) at least one will be female.</p></li>
<li><p>What is the probability of Joe (who knows absolutely nothing about \textit{Pride and Prejudice}) gets a passing grade of at least 3 out of 5 on a 5-question multiple choice test (with answers A – D for each question) by guessing at random? How does this change if there are 5 possibilities for each questions (A – E)? How does this change if there 10 questions?</p></li>
<li><p>The letters AAAKLS are in a bag. If 6 letters are drawn (without replacement) from the bag, what is the probability they spell “Alaska”?</p></li>
<li><p>A single card is drawn from a well-shuffled, standard deck of cards. What is the probability of drawing a face card? (Hint: Aces don’t have faces.)</p></li>
<li><p>What is the probability that a randomly dealt bridge hand (13 cards) has exactly 4 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\spadesuit\)</span>’s, 4 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\heartsuit\)</span>’s, 4<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\diamondsuit\)</span>’s and a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\clubsuit\)</span>’s?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the probability of rolling ``snake eyes’’ (double ones) three times in a row with a pair of fair dice?</p></li>
<li><p>When rolling two fair dice and summing (as in Monopoly or Craps), what is the probability of rolling</p>

</li>
<li><p>An urn contains 8 red marbles and 5 white marbles. If 3 are drawn at random, find the probability that:</p>

<li><p>All are white.</p></li>
<li><p>At least 2 red are drawn.</p></li>
</ul>

<li><p>Your poker opponent holds an obvious 2 pair, but you have that hand beat. The question is whether he has a full house. You know 9 cards, 5 of yours and 4 of his. What is the probability he does not have a full house?</p></li>
<li><p>In a poker game, you need a heart, either a face card or an Ace. You know the 4 cards in your hand, so what is your probability of getting the needed card?</p></li>
<li><p>A fair die is rolled and card is drawn at random from a well-shuffled, standard deck of cards. What is the probability that both the die and the card are sixes?</p></li>
<li><p>Charlie has 13 socks in a drawer, 7 blue and 6 green. If he selects 5 at random, find the probability that he gets (a) 2 blue and 3 green or (b) 1 blue and 4 green.</p></li>
<li><p>In a group of 15 people, 6 are lefties and the rest are right-handed. If 7 people are selected at random, find the probability (a) 3 lefties and 4 righties are selected, (b) no lefties are selected, or (3) exactly 1 lefty is selected.</p></li>
