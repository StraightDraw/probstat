    "Professional gamblers often talk about the **equity** or **EV** of their playing decisions. Poker pros think of every bet and call as an investment. Professional investors on Wall Street think in the same terms. **EV** stands for **expected value**, and positive **EV** is good. In both gambling and investing in the stock market, there is no guarantee that positive **EV** will lead to a positive outcome. Yet, on average and over time, playing with positive **EV** will win money. Negative *EV* is bad - it's means the play loses money on average."

    "The expected value of a probability experiment is the value that, on average, one would expect to earn if the experiment were repeated many, many times. The variance measures how widely the different outcomes spread apart. We generally prefer standard deviation over the variance because the standard deviation is in the same the units as the original outcomes.\n",

    "Why do millions of reasonably intelligent people play the lottery which has an expected value of $\\mu_X\\approx -\\$0.33$ for every dollar invested? Because of the extremely high variance. Yes, most times you lose a little bit of money, but the huge variance means that, if you win, you win really, really big. Slot machines with their $\\mu_X \\approx -\\$0.05$ per dollar work on the exact same principle, but on a much smaller scale. In fact, most gambling games take advantage of this alluring facet of probability theory: small, negative expected values paired with huge variance so that, if you do win, you have story to tell."
