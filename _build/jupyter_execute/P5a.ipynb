    "3. An urn contains 7 red and 3 green marbles. The contents are thoroughly mixed, and two marbles are drawn (w/o replacement) one after the other. Find the probability that (a) red is drawn 2nd given that red was drawn first, (b) red is drawn 2nd given that green was drawn first, and (c) green is drawn 2nd given that green was drawn first.\n",

The probability of selecting a white marble second given that a black marble was drawn first is  $\\frac{4}{5}$, and the probability of selecting a black marble on the first draw is $\\frac{1}{3}$. How many of each color marble is in the jar? \n",

You pick a door, and the host opens another door which has a goat. He then says to you, \"Do you want to stay with your pick?\" Is it to your advantage to switch or stay?"
