    "\n",
    "1. Shape?\n",
    "2. Outliers/skew?\n",
    "\n",
    "For shape, we would like to know whether the distribution is **normal** (bell-shaped). Is it *uniform* meaning all outcomes are equally likely? Is it some other known distribution like the binomial distribution? The most significant shape for introductory statistics is the **normal distribution** since parametric statistical tests like the $z$-test, the $t$-test and ANOVA are built on assumptions of normality. The second question is whether or not skew and outliers exist because we often must treat skewed data and outliers with care and possibly different tools. The first steps of data analysis are to generate numeric descriptions of the data (descriptive statistics) and typical graphical displays of data like histograms, stem plots. \n",

    "## Two Variable Plots\n",
    "One might wonder if longer waiting times correlate with longer eruptions. Perhaps more pressure builds up, then when released the eruptions last longer. Let's check a scatter plot. The first argument is the form $y\\sim x$. The $y$-variable is the dependent variable, the $x$-variable independent. In this setup, we are implicitly suggesting that the variable **eruptions** depends upon the variable **waiting**. If we reverse the order, we reverse the implicit dependence.\n",
