    "1. Enumerate all the values of the random variable.\n",
    "2. Calculate a few of the individual probabilities involved, and create a table comparing $x$ and $p(x)$.\n",
    "3. Try to find a pattern. If you can't (yet), add a few more entries to your table.\n",
    "4. Write a (closed-form) probability distribution function for the experiment, and verify the distribution function has the required properties.\n",
